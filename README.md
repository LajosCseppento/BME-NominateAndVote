Homework for the Software Architectures subject (BME, autumn of 2014)

This project was our homework for the Software Architectures (https://portal.vik.bme.hu/kepzes/targyak/VIAUM105/en/) subject during our masters course at Budapest University of Technology and Economics (Budapest, Hungary). The aim of the project was to develop a 3-layer architecture using patterns.


The project files and the documentation is also available in this repository. Unfortunately, they are in Hungarian as the language of education was Hungarian.
